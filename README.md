# My Online Portfolio & CV
This project is consisted of two parts: **an online portfolio generator** and **a CV generator**[^1]. 
Both of them are generated using [TOML](https://toml.io).

1. The online portfolio is based on [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com). 
This part is heavily influenced by  [Corey Schafer's static website tutorial](https://youtu.be/AD-3nVI3-_U). 
Instead of using a Json file, TOML format is adopted in this project.

2. The CV is written by [Typst](https://typst.app). This part is inspired by [Rendercv](https://rendercv.com).

[^1]: The CV is an open-access version, in which some personal information is not presented.
